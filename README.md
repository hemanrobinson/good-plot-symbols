# Preattentive Plot Symbols

Preattentive features are detected quickly, before normal visual processing takes place.  Preattentive features make it easier to find patterns in scatter plots by improving discriminability and reducing overlap.  
  
Graphics frameworks often use closed geometric symbols.  The distinction between closed versus open symbols is detected preattentively.  Other preattentive features include line orientation and terminators.

Preattentive processing has generally been studied by psychologists, but statisticians have an interest because of its applicability to data visualization.  [Bertin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Bertin), [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Cleveland), and [Wilkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Wilkinson) suggested the Circle, Plus, and X symbols.  
                
The preattentive literature is extensive.  A good introduction is on the [InfoVis Wiki](https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Preattentive_processing).

This project uses [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) and [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
