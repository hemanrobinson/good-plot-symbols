# Preattentive Plot Symbols

Preattentive features are detected quickly, before normal visual processing takes place.  

This project demonstrates [a set of symbols with preattentive features](https://hemanrobinson.github.io/preattentive/) to improve pattern detection in scatter plots.

This project uses [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) and [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
